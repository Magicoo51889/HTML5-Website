      <p class = "htmlParagraphs"> Html can be used to make websites, which is incredibly useful when we are in an age where information and knowledge make up the most part of our society.</p>
      
      <p class = "htmlParagraphs"> HTML's main purpose in making a website is to provide a place to put the content of the page, like paragraphs and headers, and are what actually contain the information you're trying to get out. </p>
  
      <h2 class = "htmlHeaders"> So what do you need to know to learn HTML?</h2>
  
      <p class = "htmlParagraphs"> All you need is a good code editor or IDE such as Visual Studio Code which will autofill the setup of the page (such as the version of HTML) and allows you to start coding using tags such as p and h1 which allow the browswer to know what the formatting of the page should be like. Headers are automatically made bigger than paragraphs, and they can be in six different sizes of headers, but paragraphs all remain the same (unless you use the CSS file to change the classes of different paragraphs, but I'll cover that in the CSS tutorial.)</p>
